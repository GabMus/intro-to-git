# What is a *version control system*?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

---

# Why should I care?

- Revert selected files back to a previous state
- Revert the entire project back to a previous state
- Compare changes over time
- See who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when

- Designed to be *fast* and simple to use

## Trivia

> The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your way):
> - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
> - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
> - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
> - "goddamn idiotic truckload of shit": when it breaks

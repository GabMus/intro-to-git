# What is git?

<img height="200" src="https://git-scm.com/images/branching-illustration@2x.png" />

- (*Free and open source software)*
- Distributed version control system (VCS)
- Collaborative work platform
- **Essential** software development tool

---

# What is a *version control system*?

<img src="./assets/gitflow.svg" />

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

---

# Why should I care?

- Revert selected files back to a previous state
- Revert the entire project back to a previous state
- Compare changes over time
- See who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when

# Some (very brief) history

- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux source code

![](https://i.imgur.com/OtDQT5v.gif)

- Designed to be *fast* and simple to use

---

## Trivia

> The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your way):
> - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
> - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
> - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
> - "goddamn idiotic truckload of shit": when it breaks

# ðŸ“– Basic vocabulary

- Repository (repo) <!-- A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. -->
- Clone <!-- A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online. -->
- Commit <!-- A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made. -->
- Push <!-- Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them. -->
- Pull <!-- Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. -->
- Remote <!-- This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced. -->
- Branch <!-- A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes. -->
- Fork <!-- A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original. -->

# Git is distributed

- Every *clone* of a git repo is exactly identical to the original one
- Allows for many different **workflows**
